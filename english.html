    <h1>A Day in Fu Jen Sacred Heart Senior High School</h1>
    <p>Monday, 10 March 2025 the Santa Laurensia student visited Sacred Heart Senior High School. The school is located inZhongshan District, Keelung. And this school is old, it was built in 1969 by the Dominican Sisters of Mission San Jose. When I first arrived, the first thing I see is the amount of buildings the school have. It was twice bigger than Santa Laurensia school. They have six floors and it has many classrooms throughout the hallways. I’m curious why out of all schools in Keelung we go to Sacred Heart Senior High School. I asked my teacher and turns out, our school and their school are sister schools. This school is where our adventure starts.

     <p>Meeting The Buddies</p> 
     <p> Meeting the buddies for the first time is exciting. It all started from waiting in the bus full of anticipation listening to the tour guides explanations. When suddenly a bunch of students walking towards the bus holding a name tag of our names. Everyone in the bus was so excited. Then my friend & I rushed down the bus and directly meet our buddies. My buddy and I went to the class together and sat down while waiting for the rest to come. While waiting I talked to my buddy, where we got to know each other better. By the time everybody is here, the Sacred Heart students perform a sign language song and a chinese traditional instrument. After the performance, they did a presentation about their school and country. After all that is our turn. Some of the students from Santa Laurensia presented about our school and country. I partake in presenting Indonesia to our friends from Taiwan with Carissa. That was done, we got a gift from their school. It contained a keychain, pin, and some snacks. Now for the fun part, we got divided to 4 groups and there was 4 stations. I won 3 games, the games were the castle, 4 corners, guess the move, and lastly guess the drawing.</p> 
      
     <p>Community Service Together</p> 
      <p>Visiting the Ren Ai Senior Citizen Home made me happy. We prepared some ice breaking for the elderlies. WHich is an exercise where you can sit while doing it. Then we watched the Sacred Heart students' performance. After that, it's our turn. Ryu sang 2 songs, meanwhile a group of friends performed a drama. The elderlies looked so happy that we visited. The event finished by giving small gifts to them while waving goodbye. It was such a sweet moment. We went to the bus, but stopped to look at the breathtaking view of the ocean from high up. It was magical.</p>
      
      <p>The Last Goodbyes</p>
      <p>We’re going to spend our last moments together full of happiness. We had lunch together, went to Jiufen Old Street together. We even took our last memories together by doing a photobooth. This way, we can always cherish the moments together. We made tiktoks, it was awkward but we laughed. Then we performed a traditional Indonesian dance. After that we played games for the last time. It was time to go, we all went to grab our stuffs. They walked with us back to the bus. It's sad knowing that we have to wait next year to meet them again. Then, the bus starts moving we waved goodbye the whole time. What made me feel like I’m going to miss them is that they chased after the bus while waving goodbye making it more memorable.</p>
      
      This is the most unforgettable moment in Taiwan. We laughed together, get to know each other, make tiktoks, and more. This experience can’t be repeated, but it will always be somewhere deep in my heart.
